# Neural Network for Estimating Total Viable Count of Microorganisms on Beef Cuts

Using a publicly available dataset (DOI: 10.7910/DVN/XNFVTS), which records the beef spoilage process through measurements from 11 Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors over 2220 minutes, a two-layer neural network was trained to estimate the Total Viable Count (TVC) of microorganisms. The trained neural network, with its optimized weights and biases, was subsequently deployed on a microcontroller for real-time TVC estimation.
